        <h2>To Start</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>My name is <span class="name">Nelson</span>, and I am a young computer man from Portland, Oregon.</p>
        </br>
        <p>I have only done web design for about one year and four months at this point. I started at a company called
            Fidgetech, a school for autistic individuals. I came because I wanted to try something new. It was quite
            incredible how much I learned in a quick amount of time. In this portfolio, there will be static websites
            without any interactive material, because I have not learned JavaScript or any other method to make it
            interactive.</p>

        </br>


        <p>I didnt learn much at first because of my disruptive and mean classmate whom I will not say by name. Was hard
            because they just were. Fortunately after three months I didnt have to hear from them anymore.</p>

        </br>

        <p> I got along great with Filmer at Fidgetech.</p>

        <h2>My Background</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I am from Portland, Oregon, and I speak English, Spanish, and Swedish. English is my native language, while
            Spanish and Swedish are secondary.

        </p>
        </br>

        <p>I have worked at a restaurant, hardware store, grocery store, and retail store. Of those four jobs Ive
            worked, some were better than the others. The hardware store was the nbest, while the grocery store was the
            worst.</p>

        </br>

        <p> I am Chinese-Irish-German-Swedish-American; My ancestors came to the USA between 1840 and 1980, with my
            Irish ancestors arriving first, followed by my German ancestors, then my Swedish ancestors, and then my
            Chinese ancestors</p>

        </br>

        <p>I am into history, culture, and science, and have been so since I was a child; Things like US Presidents,
            Roman Empire, Viking Age, and other eras are things I am into.</p>

        </br>

        <p>I like Mexican food, Vietnanese Food, Cuban Food, Indian Food, Ethiopian Food, Italian Food, Japanese
            Food, Swedish Food, Korean Food, and West African Food.</p>

        <h2>More things</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I grew up as an autistic child in Portland, Oregon. My childhood was not an easy one; even though I had
            food on the table, clothes on my back, and school supplies throughout my childhood and adolescense, I had
            severe mental, behavioral, social, and health problems growing up.</p>

        </br>

        <p> My greatest heroes are two deceased
            relatives; My Maternal grandmother, and Maternal great-great Aunt; my great aunt and grandmother both taught
            me about life and humanity. My grandmothter taight me about music and history, while my great-great aunt
            came from Denmark and taught me about life. </p>
