        <h2>To Start</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>My name is <span class="name">Nelson</span>, and I am a young computer man from Portland, Oregon.</p>
        </br>
        <p>I have only done web design for about one year and four months at this point. I started at a company called
            Fidgetech, a school for autistic individuals. I came because I wanted to try something new. It was quite
            incredible how much I learned in a quick amount of time. In this portfolio, there will be static websites
            without any interactive material, because I have not learned JavaScript or any other method to make it
            interactive.</p>

        </br>


        <p>I didn' t learn much at first because of my disruptive and mean classmate whom I will not say by name. Was hard
            because they just were. Fortunately after three months I didn't have to hear from them anymore.</p>

        </br>

        <p> I got along great with Filmer at Fidgetech.</p>

        <p>First site we will explore is a site about German Heritage, which is one of my heritages.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="preview">
        <h1><a href="https://21stcenturycowboy94.github.io/being-german/">Being German</a></button></h1>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Essentially, this website is about Germany, its culture, and the influence around the world. It explores
            German history, companies, modern society, and other things. It uses HTML, CSS, and images taken from
            the web (note that images are not cited, and I don't want to be penalized for plagiarism).</p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I am from Portland, Oregon, and I speak English, Spanish, and Swedish. English is my native language, while
            Spanish and Swedish are secondary.

        </p>
        </br>

        <p>I have worked at a restaurant, hardware store, grocery store, and retail store. Of those four jobs I've
            worked, some were better than the others. The hardware store was the best, while the grocery store was the
            worst. Working at the restaurant, I met nice people (coworkers), but customers left messes I had to clean
            up. The grocery store was in a rough area with homeless people and it never felt like a clean place to work.
            The retail store was ok because I met nice friends, but it was a painful job with managers who had bad
            attitudes. The reason the hardware store was awesome was because it had the best atmosphere and was the
            easiest to work and do in.
        </p>

        </br>

        <p> I am Chinese-Irish-German-Swedish-American; My ancestors came to the USA between 1840 and 1980, with my
            Irish ancestors arriving first, followed by my German ancestors, then my Swedish ancestors, and then my
            Chinese ancestors. Some ways I celebrate my heritage are St Patricks Day for my Irish heritage, Oktoberfest
            for my German heritage, Celebrate Vikings for my Swedish heritage, and celebrate Lunar New Year for my
            Chinese Heritage.</p>

        </br>

        <p>I am into history, culture, and science, and have been so since I was a child; Things like US Presidents,
            Roman Empire, Viking Age, and other eras are things I am into.</p>

        </br>

        <p>I like Mexican food, Vietnanese Food, Cuban Food, Indian Food, Ethiopian Food, Italian Food, Japanese
            Food, Swedish Food, Korean Food, and West African Food. Dishes like quesadilla, pho, tandoori chicken, lamb
            tibs, spaghetti, sushi, Swedish meatballs, kimchi, and fufu are dishes that I like. </p>

        <h2>Current things I do</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I am a political man who believes in civil rights for all, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom
            of religion, and so on. </p>

        </br>

        <p>I collect old coins and stuff from the USA and around the world. I recently found a one-crown coin from
            Norway left behind in a reject slot.</p>

        </br>

        <p>I like the study history and culture, especially of the USA, and Europe. I'm a fan of history and culture,
            including science, technology, politics, and other things. My favorite historical figures are Benjamin
            Franklin and Albert Einstein.</p>

        </br>

        <p> I'm a big fan of Elvis and The Beatles (I have dressed up and impersonated Elvis before). I listen to
            classic rock every day.</p>

        </br>

        <p>I love LEGOs, and I grew up with them. I visited the home of LEGO in Denmark in 2024, and it was a very
            bitter sweet experience.</p>

        </br>

        <p>I really like travel. Ive been to Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Mexico. My next
            destination is Australia in 2026 or 2027. My favorite place I've visited is Sweden, because of its vibe,
            and becuase I have Swedish heritage. In Sweden, I visited Stockholm, Uppsala, Gothenburg, and Malmo.</p>
