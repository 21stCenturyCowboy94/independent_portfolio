        <p>My name is <span class="name">Nelson</span>, and I am a young computer man from Portland, Oregon.</p>
        </br>
        <p>I have only done web design for about one year and four months at this point. I started at a company called
            Fidgetech, a school for autistic individuals. It was quite incredible how much I learned in a quick amount
            of time. In this portfolio, there will be static websites without any interactive material, because I have
            not learned JavaScript or any other method to do </p>

        <p>First site we will explore is a site about German Heritage, which is one of my heritages.</p>

        <p>Essentially, this website is about Germany, its culture, and the influence around the world. It uses HTML,
            CSS, and images taken from the web (note that images are nt cited, and I don't want to be penalized for
            plagiarism).</p>
