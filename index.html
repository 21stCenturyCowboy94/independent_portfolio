    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>My name is <span class="name">Nelson</span>, and I am a young computer man from Portland, Oregon.</p>
        </br>
        <p>I have only done web design for about one year and four months at this point. I started at a company called
            Fidgetech, a school for autistic individuals. It was quite incredible how much I learned in a quick amount
            of time. In this portfolio, there will be static websites without any interactive material, because I have
            not learned JavaScript or any other method to do </p>

        <p>First site we will explore is a site about German Heritage, which is one of my heritages.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Essentially, this website is about Germany, its culture, and the influence around the world. It uses HTML,
            CSS, and images taken from the web (note that images are not cited, and I don't want to be penalized for
            plagiarism).</p>

        <h2>More things</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I grew up as an autistic child in Portland, Oregon. My childhood was not an easy one; even though I had
            food on the table, clothes on my back, and school supplies throughout my childhood and adolescense, I had
            severe mental, behavioral, social, and health problems growing up. My greatest heroes are two deceased
            relatives; My Maternal granmother, and Maternal great-great Aunt. </p>
